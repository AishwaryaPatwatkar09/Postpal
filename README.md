PostPal is a Python-based OCR project designed to automate the process of extracting addresses from scanned images and identifying valid Indian PIN codes using fuzzy matching.

## Features

-  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract
-  Fuzzy matching of extracted text against a pincode dataset
-  CSV support for reference postal data
-  Modular Python functions for image input, text extraction, and pincode matching
